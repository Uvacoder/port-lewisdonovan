# Uses

Below is a list of tools that I use in my day-to-day, to make the job of coding as efficient as possible.

## Text editor

* *[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)* (also known as *VSCode*) is, in my opinion, the best code editor out there.
    * Font
        * I use *Fira Code*, which is actually a Google Font, but there's [an awesome ligatured version](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions) available on GitHub, which is what I use.
    * Colour Theme
        * I use *Material Theme Palenight High Contrast* which is part of the [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) package.
    * Icons
        * I use the *Seti icon set* which ships with VSCode.
    * Extensions
        * [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/) VSCode now ships with Emmet support built in, but it's worth mentioning as it's a *huge* timesaver!
        * [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)
        * [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)
        * [JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets)
        * [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
        * [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight)

## Browser

I use *[Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com)*. It can be a bit heavy on RAM, but its set of developer tools are far superior to anything else available.

## Terminal

I use *[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)* with *zsh* and *oh-my-zsh* installed. I highly recommend this setup, and there's a fantastic tutorial [here](https://medium.com/ayuth/iterm2-zsh-oh-my-zsh-the-most-power-full-of-terminal-on-macos-bdb2823fb04c) that will guide you through it.
