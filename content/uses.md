## Text editor

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (also known as *VSCode*) is, in my opinion, the best IDE software available.

#### Font
I use *Fira Code*, which is actually a Google Font, but there's [an awesome ligatured version](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions) available on GitHub, which is what I use.

#### Colour Theme
I use *Material Theme Palenight High Contrast* which is part of the [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) package.

#### Icons
I use the *Seti icon set* which ships with VSCode.

#### Extensions
* [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode now ships with Emmet support built in, but it's worth mentioning as it's a *huge* timesaver!)
* [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)
* [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)
* [JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
* [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight)

## Browser

As a developer, I use *[Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com)*. It can be a bit heavy on RAM, but its set of devtools are far superior to anything else available. If you're looking for something more visually extensible (and some great tab management features) *[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)* is fantastic. If you're privacy-conscious, *[Brave](https://brave.com)* is also a great alternative.

## Terminal

I use *[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)* with *zsh* and *oh-my-zsh* installed. I highly recommend this setup, and there's a fantastic tutorial [here](https://medium.com/ayuth/iterm2-zsh-oh-my-zsh-the-most-power-full-of-terminal-on-macos-bdb2823fb04c) that will guide you through it.
