## Work

For my day-job, I'm the Lead Web Developer at [4th Floor Creative Group](https://4thfloorcreative.co.uk), the in-house creative arm of [Sony Music UK](https://sonymusic.co.uk).

In my free time I enjoy the great outdoors, cooking, travelling keeping fit and playing football. Feel free to [follow me on Instagram](https://instagram.com/lewisjdonovan) for all of that good stuff!
