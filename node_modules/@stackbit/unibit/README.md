# Unibit

Unibit is a superset of existing static site generators, if you build a theme
according to the [Unibit spec](https://docs.stackbit.com/unibit/) then 
[Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com) will be able to convert (transpile) it into 
a host of target SSGs. 

The following conversions are currently supported by Stackbit:
* **Static Site Generators**: Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js
* **Headless CMS**: Forestry, Netlify CMS, DatoCMS, Contentful, Sanity
